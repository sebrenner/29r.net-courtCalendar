jStorage is a simple wrapper plugin for Prototype, MooTools and jQuery to store data on
browser side and to replace the use of cookies for storing data.

jStorage is able to save almost any kind of data (strings, numbers, objects, even XML nodes)
only object methods and functions are left out.

jStorage was first developed under the name of DOMCached (http://www.domcached.com) but since 
a lot of features were dropped to make it simpler (like the support for namespaces and such) 
it was renamed. DOMCached had separate files for working with Prototype and jQuery but jStorage 
can handle both in one go.

jStorage makes use of HTML5 local storage where available and userData behavior in 
Internet Explorer older versions. Webkit SQLite is not supported.

Current availability: jStorage supports all major browsers - Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 2+, 
Safari 4+, Chrome 4+, Opera 10.50+

If the browser doesn't support data caching, then no exceptions are raised - jStorage can still 
be used by the script but nothing is actually stored.
 	
jStorage is really small, just 2 kB when minified!
